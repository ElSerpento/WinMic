# WinMic
An app for sending android mic audio to windows over local network. To use, input your computer's IPv4 address on the android app then hit record, then run the windows side app, which should give you audio. Windows side still not done, use the python script in the folder. You need to install VBCable and play the sound to the VBCable input device to use it as a mic for now.
