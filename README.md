# WinMic
A very half-assedly made (still not finished) app for sending android mic audio to windows over local network. To use, input your computer's IPv4 address on the android app then hit record, then run the windows side app, which should give you audio. Since i'm lazy, i still haven't done the windows side app (i haven't even completed android side) so the python script above is what i'm using for now as a replacement.

That script plays audio to the speakers, but you can modify it to send audio to a VBCable input device to use it as a mic.
